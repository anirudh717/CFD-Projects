This is a 1-D Compressible Euler Equations Solver. 

It simulates an acoustic pressure wave with the Time-Domain Impedance Boundary Condition(TDIBC) imposed on the left wall.

The staggered grid is used in the flow domain with 2 adiabatic walls enclosing the domain. 

TDIBC constraint is imposed on the left wall and no-slip constraint is imposed on the right wall.

A 4th-order accurate Compact Finite Difference (Pade)-based flux interpolation scheme is used to approximate the functional values and derivatives

The Time integration is performed using a 2nd-order accurate MacCormack Scheme

The Pressure wave is visualized as the result.
