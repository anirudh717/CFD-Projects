This is a 1-D Compressible Euler Equations Solver 

The staggered grid is used in the flow domain with 2 adiabatic no-slip walls enclosing the domain

A 4th-order accurate Compact Finite Difference (Pade)-based flux interpolation scheme is used to approximate the functional values and derivatives

The Time integration is performed using a 2nd-order accurate MacCormack Scheme

The Pressure wave is visualized as the result
